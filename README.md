# bimodal_emotion_recognition
This repository covers the practical part of my master thesis project. 

The aim of this project is designing and implementing the fusion of textual data and facial expressions for video-based emotion prediction. The system is tested on the basis of the famous Dutch soap opera "Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden". The research is conducted in collaboration with the media company RTL Nederland.
